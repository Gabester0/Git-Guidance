            <p>Thanks for looking at my introductory Git Guide.  I recently went from zero
                to greater than zero with regards to my Git skills thanks to the guidance 
                of others and I want to help others do the same thing.  I hope you find this
                guide helpful.  This is not a comprehensive guide to all beginner skills.  This
                is simply a guide that can walk you through how to implement GIT into your 
                regular workflow with minimal fuss and command memorization.  
                  
            </p>

        <section id="introduction_and_installation" class="main-section">
            <header>Introduction and installation</header>
                <article>
                    <p>All right lets get going!  What is GIT?  It is a free open-source 
                        Version Control system.  What does that mean for you?  There are 
                        a lot of different really good reasons to use GIT.  The simplest 
                        answer in my opinion is that GIT allows you to fearlessly play, 
                        change, and experiment with your code without any fear of breaking
                        your code.  And it allows simple efficient social coding.  If you are 
                        going to work professionally with code you will probably need to learn 
                        it.   
                     
                        So, first thing is downloading <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">GIT 
                        for Windows</a></p>

                        <img src="images/Download.png" alt="install starting image">
                        
                        <p>Once 
                        the download finishes choose a folder to save it to.  When this is 
                        finished go to the file where you saved it to and click on the executable
                        file.  This will initiate the installation process. </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/Install1.png" alt="install terms">

                        <p> Once you accept the 
                        terms it will create a GIT folder in your Programs folder.  You should 
                        accept the default settings.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/Install2.png" alt="install folder location">

                        <p>Next it will give you some checkboxes for whether
                        you want the a desktop shortcut, a GIT GUI (or graphical user interface), 
                        and other options.  I recommend doing whatever you want but don't unselect 
                        the automatic options.  </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/Install3.png" alt="install options">

                        <p>Next you can choose your a folder name in the Start Menu.  This is really
                            just where you would go to look for GIT.  If you are like me simple is 
                            better and you will just leave the file name GIT.  </p>

                        <img src="images/Install4.png" alt="Start Folder">

                        <p>
                        Now we choose wether we want to use the GIT Bash (terminal) only or 
                        Windows Command Prompt (the windows terminal).  There is a third option that you 
                        will want to ignore because it is the most risky option.  The Git Bash is a GIT 
                        terminal that allows you 
                        to enter commands.  This option is the safest.  I would stick with the default 
                        Windows terminal because this lets you use either the GIT Bash or the Windows
                        Terminal and is nearly as safe.  
                        </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/Install5.png" alt="Terminal Options">

                        <p>
                        Now just leave the rest of the options on the 
                        default settings and click next until it begins installation.  If any 
                        of these choices matter I don't know about it and you can teach me!
                        </p>

                        <img src="images/Install12.png" alt="Installing Now">

                        <p>
                        Once the installation finishes
                        you can select the checkbox that says to open the GIT Bash.  </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/â€ŒInstallSuccess.png" alt="Installation Succesful">

                        <p>If you are using 
                        Visual Studio Code you can actually just open the Code editor and type Control - Plus - 
                        Back-tick.  (The back-tick is the key to the left of the 1 key.)  This opens the
                        integrated Visual Studio terminal.  
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Say Hello To Your Terminal!
                </p>
                     
                    <img alt="A blank terminal" src="WelcomeToTerminal.png">

                 
                <p>
                    This is a terminal.  It is also called the CLI or Command Line Interface.  A terminal looks 
                    like an ancient computer.  But in spite of the fact that it is a total blast from the past
                    it is going to rock your developing mind. 
    
                    If you look at the screen you will see <code>'C:\Users\Gabe'</code>.  This actually mirrors the folder
                    structure of your computer.  We are in the LocalDisk(C), the Users folder, and I am logged in 
                    to my Personal Computer so we see my name username (which is my name) Gabe.  
                     
                </p>

                <!--dir Command-->
                <p>
                    Ok how do we move around and do anything?  We can move around by selecting the folder we want
                    to go to.  It is helpful to know the folder name.  But if you didn't memorize all the folders
                    inside your computer it isn't quite so simple.  But we have a command to see where you are.  Type 
                    <code>dir</code> into the terminal and hit enter.  
                </p>
                     
                    <img alt="The dir command" src="dirCmd.png">

                <p>
                    The <code>dir</code> command is short for directory.  It shows you the contents of the directory
                    (or folder) you are currently in.  So now you know what all your folder names are.  
                    <!--cd Command-->
                    So lets pick a folder.  To go into a folder type <code>cd FreeCodeCamp</code>.  CD stands for 'Change 
                    Directory' and FreeCodeCamp is the name of the folder I selected.  You can always prompt the terminal to
                    auto-complete the folder name by hitting Tab.  If the terminal has options and it guessed wrong you can 
                    keep hitting tab until you see the right folder name.  When you see the correct folder name 
                    or you finish typing it hit Enter. 
                </p>
                     
                    <img alt="cd command" src="changeDirCmd.png">
                 
                <p>
                    Now you see the list of folder names includes Free Code Camp.  This list of folder names just
                    tells you where in your folders you are.  The last folder listed is the one you are currently in. 
                    You navigated in the terminal!  To go back one level type <code>cd ..</code>.  This time instead of 
                    using the change directory command to go into a folder you are using it to back out of your folder you
                    are in to get to the parent folder.  
                </p>
                     
                    <img alt="cd up command" src="changeDirUpCmd.png">
            
                 
                <p>
                    Now you are back in the Gabe folder where we started.  This is how you navigate around the 
                    terminal.  When you want to use GIT on a group of files you want to navigagte to the folder
                    in question.  See you in the next section.  
                </p>
            </article>

        <section id="creating_and_initiating" class="main-section">
            <header>Creating and initiating</header>
            <p>So now we know how to navigate around our files and we have GIT installed.  So first we are going
                create a directory.  So pick a location for this new file.  
            </p>
            <p>Now use your <code>cd</code> command and navigate to the folder where you want your new folder to 
                be located.  Now enter <code>mkdir DemoFolder</code>.  DemoFolder should be whatever you want your 
                new folder to be named. 
            </p> 
             
            <img alt="mkdir command" src="mkdirCmd.png">
             
            <p>
            And now we see a summary below.  We see a line that tells us what our folders parent folders are.
            And below this we see a summary of our last time we made changes to (or created in this case) our 
            folder and the name of our new folder DemoFolder.  
            Now we can go into the folder we created.  Now that we are in our folder we can initiate GIT.  We
            do this with the <code>git init</code> command. </p>
             
            <img alt="git init command" src="gitInitCmd.png">
             
            <p>
            What does this mean?  On a technical level I don't know entirely.  Don't overthink it.  Basically 
            your should think of this as similar to installing an app on your device.  You have to do it to use it.  
            With GIT you have to install it For every device you use it on.  And you have to initiate it in every
            folder you want to use it with.  As a rule you will pick your project's primary folder that will 
            contain all the files and folders associated with it and initiate GIT in that folder.   
            </p>
            <p>
                So initiating GIT basically adds GIT to the folder your are in and this will allow you to use
                GIT to track your files inside this folder.  <code>git init</code> also creates a Master branch 
                for you automatically.  So what are branches?  Basically branches are what allow you to have 
                and keep organized multiple versions of your code.  The Master branch is the default branch.  
                Typically you want to keep your Master branch uncluttered.  If you want to try something that 
                might not work you make a separate branch to mess with it.  Each time you make a branch you 
                are making a duplicate of the branch you were in.  Then you write some code, decide if you 
                are keeping it or ditching it.  You can merge it back into a branch which will adopt your changes.  
            </p>
            <p>
            So how do we know we have a master branch?
            Let us use the <code>git status</code> command.  
            </p>
            <img alt="GIT status command" src="gitStatusCmd.png">
            <p>
            This is a really useful versatile command.  It will tell you what is going on with regards to GIT.
            For example we have GIT initiated in our empty <code>DemoFolder</code>.  We can tell that GIT is 
            active because we see a status update.  We are on Branch Master.  No Commits yet.  Commits are how 
            changes are packaged up.  And below that we see there is nothing to commit.  Since we just created 
            an empty folder that seems about right!
            </p>

        <section id="linking_github_remotely" class="main-section">
            <header>Linking Github Remotely</header>
            <p>So in this section we are going to use the <code>git config</code> command to set up GIT. 
            <code>config</code> is obviously an abbreviation for configure.  So we are telling GIT that we
            want to configure our global settings.  So we are going to first enter this command <code>git 
            config --global user.name "User name"</code> with your name in the quotation marks.  Then
            hit Enter.  As long as you don't see an error command this worked.  Now we enter <code>git 
            config --global user.email user@example.com</code> with your email address. </p>
