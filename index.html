            <header>Introduction and Assumptions</header>
            <p>Thanks for looking at my introductory Git Guide.  I recently went from zero
                to greater than zero with regards to my Git skills thanks to the guidance 
                of others and I want to help others do the same thing.  I hope you find this
                guide helpful.  
                <br/><br/>
            </p>
                <header class="secondaryHeader">I am assuming the following things about you:</header>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You have a computer</li>
                        <li>You have a code editor installed</li>
                        <li>If you don't have a code editor installed 
                            you will go download one and then return</li>
                        <li>I like Visual Studio Code.  
                            There are many good ones out there.  
                            Just pick one you have heard of and try it.  </li>
                        <li>You know how to write some code of some kind</li>
                        <li>You have a Github account</li>
                        <li>If you don't you might as well get one because it is free</li>
                        <li>This is optional.  
                            Only half of what we will be covering will be pointless 
                            if you don't.</li>

                <article>
                    <p>All right lets get going!  What is GIT?  It is a free open source 
                        Version Control system.  What does that mean for you?  There are 
                        a lot of different really good reasons to use GIT.  The simplest 
                        answer in my opinion is that GIT allows you to fearlessly play, 
                        change, and experiment with your code without any fear of breaking
                        your code.  And it allows simple efficient social coding.  If you are 
                        going to work professionally with code you will probably need to learn 
                        it.   
                    <br/>
                        So, first thing is downloading GIT.  
                        <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">GIT for Windows</a>  Once 
                        the download finishes choose a folder to save it to.  When this is 
                        finished go to the file where you saved it to and click on the executable
                        file.  This will initiate the installation process.  Once you accept the 
                        terms it will create a GIT folder in your Programs folder.  You should 
                        accept the default settings.  Next it will give you some checkboxes for whether
                        you want the a desktop shortcut, a GIT GUI (or graphical user interface), 
                        and other options.  I recommend doing whatever you want but don't unselect 
                        the automatic options.  Next you can change the name of the folder.  Why bother?
                    <br/>
                        Now we choose wether we want to use the GIT Bash (terminal) only or 
                        Windows Command Prompt (the windows terminal).  There is a third option that you 
                        will want to ignore becauseit is the most risky option.  The Git Bash is a GIT 
                        terminal that allows you 
                        to enter commands.  This option is the safest.  I would stick with the default 
                        Windows terminal because this lets you use either the GIT Bash or the Windows
                        Terminal and is nearly as safe.  Now just leave the rest of the options on the 
                        default settings and click next until it begins installation.  Once this installs
                        you can find and open the GIT Bash or the Command Prompt.  If you are using 
                        Visual Studio Code you can actually just open that and then hit Control - Plus - 
                        Backtick.  (The back-tick is the key to the left of the 1 key.)  This opens the
                        integrated Visual Studio terminal.  
                    </p>

            <header>Navigating The Terminal</header>
            <article>Say Hello To Your Terminal!
                <br>
                <img src="WelcomeToTerminal.png">
                <br>
                This is a terminal.  It is also called the CLI or Command Line Interface.  A terminal looks 
                like an ancient computer.  But in spite of the fact that it is a total blast from the past
                it is going to rock your developing mind. 

                If you look at the screen you will see <code>'C:\Users\Gabe'</code>.  This actually mirrors the folder
                structure of your computer.  We are in the LocalDisk(C), the Users folder, and I am logged in 
                to my Personal Computer so we see my name username (which is my name) Gabe.  
                <br>
                <!--dir Command-->
                Ok how do we move around and do anything?  We can move around by selecting the folder we want
                to go to.  It is helpful to know the folder name.  But if you didn't memorize all the folders
                inside your computer it isn't quite so simple.  But we have a command to see where you are.  Type 
                <code>dir</code> into the terminal and hit enter.  
                <br>
                <img src="dirCmd.png">
                The <code>dir</code> command is short for directory.  It shows you the contents of the directory
                (or folder) you are currently in.  So now you know what all your folder names are.  
                <!--cd Command-->
                So lets pick a folder.  To go into a folder type <code>cd FreeCodeCamp</code>.  CD stands for 'Change 
                Directory' and FreeCodeCamp is the name of the folder I selected.  You can always prompt the terminal to
                auto-complete the folder name by hitting tab.  If the terminal has options and it guessed wrong you can 
                keep hitting tab until you see the right folder name.  When you do hit enter. 
                <br/>
                <img src="changeDirCmd.png">
                <br/>
                Now you see the list of folder names includes Free Code Camp.  This list of folder names just
                tells you where in your folders you are.  The last folder listed is the one you are currently in. 
                You navigated in the terminal!  To go back one level type <code>cd ..</code>.  This time instead of 
                using the change directory command to go into a folder you are using it to back out of your folder you
                are in to get to the parent folder.  
                <br/>
                <img src="changeDirUpCmd.png">
                <br/>
                Now you are back in the Gabe folder where we started.  This is how you navigate around the 
                terminal.  When you want to use GIT on a group of files you want to navigagte to the folder
                in question.  See you in the next section.
