                    <p>
                        Thanks for looking at my introductory Git Guide.  I recently went from zero
                        to greater than zero with regards to my Git skills thanks to the guidance 
                        of others and I want to help others do the same thing.  I hope you find this
                        guide helpful.  This is not a comprehensive guide to all beginner skills.  This
                        is simply a guide that can walk you through how to implement GIT into your 
                        regular workflow with minimal fuss and command memorization.

                <article>
                    <p>
                        All right lets get going!  What is GIT?  It is a free open-source 
                        Version Control system.  What does that mean for you?  There are 
                        a lot of different really good reasons to use GIT.  The simplest 
                        answer in my opinion is that GIT allows you to fearlessly play, 
                        change, and experiment with your code without any fear of breaking
                        your code.  And it allows simple efficient social coding.  If you are 
                        going to work professionally with code you will probably need to learn 
                        it.  So, first thing is downloading <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">GIT 
                        for Windows</a>
                    </p>

                        <img src="images/installation/Download.png" alt="installation beginning">
                        
                    <p>
                        Once 
                        the download finishes choose a folder to save it to.  When this is 
                        finished go to the file where you saved it to and click on the executable
                        file.  This will initiate the installation process. 
                    </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/installation/Install1.png" alt="installation terms and conditions">

                    <p> 
                        Once you accept the 
                        terms it will create a GIT folder in your Programs folder.  You should 
                        accept the default settings.  
                    </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/installation/Install2.png" alt="installation choose folder location">

                    <p>
                        Next it will give you some checkboxes for whether
                        you want the a desktop shortcut, a GIT GUI (or graphical user interface), 
                        and other options.  I recommend doing whatever you want but don't unselect 
                        the automatic options.  
                    </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/installation/Install3.png" alt="setup options">

                    <p>
                        Next you can choose your a folder name in the Start Menu.  This is really
                        just where you would go to look for GIT.  If you are like me simple is 
                        better and you will just leave the file name GIT.  
                    </p>

                        <img src="images/installation/Install4.png" alt="Name Start Menu Folder">

                    <p>
                        Now we choose wether we want to use the GIT Bash (terminal) only or 
                        Windows Command Prompt (the windows terminal).  There is a third option that you 
                        will want to ignore because it is the most risky option.  The Git Bash is a GIT 
                        terminal that allows you 
                        to enter commands.  This option is the safest.  I would stick with the default 
                        Windows terminal because this lets you use either the GIT Bash or the Windows
                        Terminal and is nearly as safe.  
                    </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/installation/Install5.png" alt="Terminal Setup Options">

                    <p>
                        Now just leave the rest of the options on the 
                        default settings and click next until it begins installation.  If any 
                        of these choices matter I don't know about it and you can teach me!
                    </p>

                        <img src="images/installation/Install12.png" alt="Installing">

                    <p>
                        Once the installation finishes
                        you can select the checkbox that says to open the GIT Bash.  
                    </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/installation/â€ŒInstallSuccess.png" alt="Installation Succesful">

                    <p>
                        If you are using 
                        Visual Studio Code you can actually just open the Code editor and type Control - Plus - 
                        Back-tick.  (The back-tick is the key to the left of the 1 key.)  This opens the
                        integrated Visual Studio terminal.

                    <p>
                        Say Hello To Your Terminal!
                    </p>
                     
                        <img alt="A blank terminal" src="images/navigating_the_terminal/WelcomeToTerminal.png">

                    <p>
                        This is a terminal.  It is also called the CLI or Command Line Interface.  A terminal looks 
                        like an ancient computer.  But in spite of the fact that it is a total blast from the past
                        it is going to rock your developing mind. 
                    
                        If you look at the screen you will see <code>'C:\Users\Gabe'</code>.  This actually mirrors the folder
                        structure of your computer.  We are in the LocalDisk(C), the Users folder, and I am logged in 
                        to my Personal Computer so we see my name username (which is my name) Gabe.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ok how do we move around and do anything?  We can move around by selecting the folder we want
                        to go to.  It is helpful to know the folder name.  But if you didn't memorize all the folders
                        inside your computer it isn't quite so simple.  But we have a command to see where you are.  Type 
                        <code>dir</code> into the terminal and hit enter.  
                    </p>

                        <img alt="The dir command" src="images/navigating_the_terminal/dirCmd.png">

                    <p>
                        The <code>dir</code> command is short for directory.  It shows you the contents of the directory
                        (or folder) you are currently in.  So now you know what all your folder names are.  
                        So lets pick a folder.  To go into a folder type <code>cd FreeCodeCamp</code>.  CD stands for 'Change 
                        Directory' and FreeCodeCamp is the name of the folder I selected.  You can always prompt the terminal to
                        auto-complete the folder name by hitting Tab.  If the terminal has options and it guessed wrong you can 
                        keep hitting tab until you see the right folder name.  When you see the correct folder name 
                        or you finish typing it hit Enter. 
                    </p>

                        <img alt="cd command" src="images/navigating_the_terminal/changeDirCmd.png">

                    <p>
                        Now you see the list of folder names includes Free Code Camp.  This list of folder names just
                        tells you where in your folders you are.  The last folder listed is the one you are currently in. 
                        You navigated in the terminal!  To go back one level type <code>cd ..</code>.  This time instead of 
                        using the change directory command to go into a folder you are using it to back out of your folder you
                        are in to get to the parent folder.  
                    </p>

                        <img alt="cd up command" src="images/navigating_the_terminal/changeDirUpCmd.png">
                
                    <p>
                        Now you are back in the Gabe folder where we started.  This is how you navigate around the 
                        terminal.  When you want to use GIT on a group of files you want to navigagte to the folder
                        in question.  See you in the next section.

            <header><h4>Creating and initiating</h4></header>

                <article>

                    <p>
                        So now we know how to navigate around our files and we have GIT installed.  So first we are going
                        create a directory.  So pick a location for this new file.  
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Now use your <code>cd</code> command and navigate to the folder where you want your new folder to 
                        be located.  Now enter <code>mkdir DemoFolder</code>.  DemoFolder should be whatever you want your 
                        new folder to be named. 
                    </p> 
    
                        <img alt="mkdir command" src="images/creating_and_initiating/mkdirCmd.png">
    
                    <p>
                        And now we see a summary below.  We see a line that tells us what our folders parent folders are.
                        And below this we see a summary of our last time we made changes to (or created in this case) our 
                        folder and the name of our new folder DemoFolder.  
                        Now we can go into the folder we created.  Now that we are in our folder we can initiate GIT.  We
                        do this with the <code>git init</code> command. 
                    </p>
    
                        <img alt="git init command" src="images/creating_and_initiating/gitInitCmd.png">
    
                    <p>
                        What does this mean?  On a technical level I don't know entirely.  Don't overthink it.  Basically 
                        your should think of this as similar to installing an app on your device.  You have to do it to use it.  
                        With GIT you have to install it For every device you use it on.  And you have to initiate it in every
                        folder you want to use it with.  As a rule you will pick your project's primary folder that will 
                        contain all the files and folders associated with it and initiate GIT in that folder.   
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        So initiating GIT basically adds GIT to the folder your are in and this will allow you to use
                        GIT to track your files inside this folder.  <code>git init</code> also creates a Master branch 
                        for you automatically.  So what are branches?  Basically branches are what allow you to have 
                        and keep organized multiple versions of your code.  The Master branch is the default branch.  
                        Typically you want to keep your Master branch clean.  If you want to try something that 
                        might not work you make a separate branch to mess with it.  Each time you make a branch you 
                        are making a duplicate of the branch you were in.  Then you write some code, decide if you 
                        are keeping it or ditching it.  You can merge it back into a branch which will adopt your changes.  
                        A helpful way to think of this is the Master branch is for stable code that you know works.  
                        Anything experimental or unstable (a work in progress) is better worked on in a branch.  This allows
                        you to minimize the time lost due to failed experiments that changed parts of your code that worked.  
                        And combining (or merging) your succesful experiments is easy.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We will only be covering merging branches on Github.  You can merge branches on your local machine.  
                        We will cover this more later but I don't 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        So how do we know we have a master branch?
                        Let us use the <code>git status</code> command.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is a really useful versatile command.  It will tell you what is going on with regards to GIT.
                        For example we have GIT initiated in our empty <code>DemoFolder</code>.  We can tell that GIT is 
                        active because we see a status update.  We are on Branch Master.  No Commits yet.  Commits are how 
                        changes are packaged up.  If you add all your changes into the commit you are basically bundling
                        your entire branch into the commit.  If you select individual files to add then you are not
                        bundling the entire branch.  And below that we see there is nothing to commit.  Since we just 
                        created an empty folder that seems about right!

            <header><h4>Adding and Committing</h4></header>

                <article>

                    <p>
                        Now we are ready to start using GIT.  We start by creating a file and writing some code in it.
                        I am just making a really simple index.html file and giving it a title.  
                    </p>
    
                        <img src="images/adding_and_committing/Write_html.png" alt="Creating an HTML file">
    
                    <p>
                        So we wrote code.  Now lets check in with GIT to see what it thinks about this.  So we will
                        use the <code>git status</code> command to check on our new file.  
                    </p>
    
                        <img src="images/adding_and_committing/staging_git_status.png" alt="Git status command">
    
                    <p>
                        So we see our new file appear in red.  Everything we saw before after using the <code>git init        
                        </code> command is still there along with text telling us that there are untracked files.  
                        Then it lists the files or file that is untracked.  Below this we see it tells us how to change 
                        this.  This tells us that GIT is aware of the file.  But we haven't asked GIT to track the file
                        for us yet so it isn't.  So let's do that.  You can either use the file name to do this by typing
                        <code>git add index.html</code>.  This way works if you only want to add some files to be tracked
                        but not others.  In our case we will use <code>git add *</code> to add everything to be tracked.  
                        The asterisk is commonly used to denote everything, or all possible in computer science.  
                    </p>
    
                        <img src="images/adding_and_committing/git_add.png" alt="git add all command">
    
                    <p>
                        Now we should check the status to see if it really worked.
                    </p>
    
                        <img src="images/adding_and_committing/added_status.png" alt="git status to verify added status">
    
                    <p>
                        Awesome!  It is green instead of red.  Now GIT is tracking the file.  There is actually a name
                        for this.  Files that are being tracked but are not yet committed are in the "Staging Area."  
                        The proper name for this is "Index;" I find this unhelpful and confusing so I am just going to
                        refer to it as the staging area.   
                        So now you have GIT tracking the file but you are not committed to the file yet.  The staging 
                        area could be thought of like a loading dock.  You have your items you are shipping in the loading
                        dock so they are safely contained.  But you don't have to ship them out.  You can pick what you want
                        from the loading dock to pack on the trucks.  In the same way with GIT you can change your mind and 
                        add, remove, or edit files from the staging area without committing to them. 
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        So lets make a commit.  When you make a commit you are strongly encouraged to include a commit 
                        message.  This is considered a good practice because GIT is often used by teams of developers who 
                        are all working on the same code base so more communication is usually helpful.  There is a way to
                        do this without but why not set good habits and practice writing a short meaninful message about 
                        what your commit will contain.  So we will write <code>git commit -m 'First commit'</code> and 
                        hit Enter.  
                    </p>
    
                        <img src="images/adding_and_committing/commit.png" alt="make a commit">
    
                    <p>
                        And you have executed your first commit!  You will see below <code>[Master (root-commit) 
                        a084555] First commit</code>.  
                        This is telling you that you have made a commit to the Master Branch.  Then there is a id number
                        for this commit along with the message we wrote.  We also see a summary
                        of what was in the commit.  It says that there were 13 insertions because before there was 
                        no index.html file and now our master branch has this file.  The index.html file is thirteen
                        lines long so GIT counts each line as an insertion.  Now the we have made a commit to the Master
                        branch.  In this process we simply made changes by adding a file.  Then we committed that to 
                        the master branch.  This means that we basically merged our changes into the Master branch.  
                        This is a perfectly good way of changing the file.  It is better to only use this method 
                        if you are doing things you know you know how to do.  If you are making changes you are not 
                        sure you will want to keep you will want to do this on a separate branch.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>    
                        In the next section we will learn about making branches and how that can 
                        allow us to make changes and then get rid of them or keep them without having to remember what
                        all our changes were.

                    <p>
                        Branches are something that allows you to create a dublicate of your current repository.  The 
                        can be deleted, saved, or merged with the master.  Creating a branch is quick and easy.  To do
                        this you use the <code>git checkout -b yourBranchNameHere</code>.  <code>Checkout</code> means you are 
                        switching to this branch.  <code>-b</code> is for branch.  <code>yourBranchNameHere</code> is going
                        to be whatever you want this branch to be named.  For our examples we will call it day3 because that 
                        is the name from some of my example screenshots!  Feel free to name these whatever you want.  When 
                        in doubt it is probably wise to be pretty formulaic in your name choices.  Try to give branches 
                        names that will help you stay organized.  
                    </p>
    
                        <img src="images/branching/git_branch.png" alt="git branch command">
    
                    <p>
                        And just like that you see <code>Switched to a new branch 'day3'</code> telling you
                        that you switched to a new branch.  Now you can go crazy and do whatever you want.  Or if you 
                        want to go back to master branch you can say <code>git checkout master</code>.  <code>git checkout</code>
                        will take you back and forth.  If your get confused <code>git branch</code> will tell you which branch you
                        are in and list all other branches.  You can think of it as checking out a branch to your code editor where 
                        you can work on it and modify it.  If you make changes to your current branch and try to switch branches 
                        without adding your changes to the staging area GIT will stop you.  You can add and commit changes to 
                        your branch and they will be tracked and saved by GIT.  The beauty of branches is that they are simple
                        and quick to create and you can keep what you have created or delete them.    
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Don't forget to do something with our day3 branch!  Since our repository is just an HTML 
                        index file with a title let's change the title.  We will go with a corny GIT pun.
                        <code>GIT IT!</code> will be our new title.  Now use your GIT skills we are learning
                        and save the file, add the file to the staging area, and make a commit for the day3 branch. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is everything that we are going to cover here regarding using GIT locally.  You can do just 
                        this and be perfectly happy.  If keeping your code private is a concern you may prefer to only 
                        use GIT locally.  GIT is an open-source free Source Control software.  Github is a company that is 
                        built on top of GIT which you can use to share your code with others, collabaratively code with others,
                        and more.  Github is a wonderful site if you want people to see your code.  You can use
                        Github with privately but it costs money.  The rest of this guide will cover configuring your 
                        GIT setup, creating a repository, adding a remote connection, pushing our master to the remote
                        repository, pushing a branch, creating a pull request, merging the pull request, and updating
                        the local master.  All of these are aspects of storing your code on Github and how to communicate
                        with the Github repository.

                        So in this section we are going to use the <code>git config</code> command to set up GIT. 
                        <code>config</code> is obviously an abbreviation for configure.  So we are telling GIT that we
                        want to configure our global settings.  So we are going to first enter this command <code>git 
                        config --global user.name "User name"</code> with your name in the quotation marks.  Then
                        hit Enter.  As long as you don't see an error command this worked.  Now we enter <code>git 
                        config --global user.email user@example.com</code> with your email address.

                    <p>
                        So to create a repository on Github first you need to log in to your
                        Github account.  Find the plus symbol and click on it.  Select the 
                        create new repository option.  
                    </p>
                                         
                        <img src="images/creating_new_repository/create_github_repository.png" alt="new repository setup">

                    <p>
                        Choose a title for the repository.  
                        If you want to you can add a description of the project.  There are
                        few more options like choosing a liscence for your project.  This isn't 
                        going to matter much today with our example repository so don't worry 
                        about this.  There is an option to select a .gitignore.  Leave this as none.
                        There is also an option to initialize your repository with a
                        ReadMe.  Normally these are great, but for the moment don't do this.  
                        It is really easy to add one later but right now it will make it more 
                        complicated.  So for today just give your repository a title and 
                        click create the repository.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now pause on this screen.  This screen gives us instructions for different
                        scenarios.  We want the second option "Push an existing repository from the 
                        command line."  You can actually just click the clipboard icon to the right
                        and then paste (Ctrl-V) the code into the command line.  I reccomend typing 
                        the commands manually instead to get used to them.  Having to manually type
                        commands helps you to notice the parts of the command without forcing yourself
                        to.  It can also be better if you tend to learn by doing.

                        For our example you have me to guide you and we won't be doing it exactly
                        the same because we are going a little out of order.  But just know that if you
                        want Github to tell you what to do you need to not initialize your repository with a
                        ReadMe.

            <header><h4>Adding a Remote URL</h4></header>

                <article>

                    <p>
                        Now for remotes.  To explain this (as well as I understand it at least) I want to 
                        review where we are.  Only from GIT's perspective.  So we have a local GIT repository
                        with a Master Branch and our day3 branch which has a different title.  We have a commit 
                        we created in our day3 branch with the different title but we haven't
                        committed it to Master yet.  And we have a currently unconnected Github repository 
                        that is empty.  So the first thing we need to do is establish our master branch in 
                        the new empty Github repository.  The Github repository is what we call a remote.  
                        It is a remote machine (a Github server located who knows where) that houses our
                        repository.  So first of all we actually need to go back to the terminal and switch 
                        from our day3 branch to the 
                        master branch.  If we forgot this we would end up with the Master and our day3 branch
                        switched with each other on Github which would just be confusing and cause issues.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ok now we are ready to add the remote.  So So the command is <code>git remote add origin
                        https://github.com/yourUserName/yourRepositoryName.Git</code>.  So we telling GIT that 
                        the command is about a Remote and we want it to add an origin.  So first, the name origin
                        is referring to the URL for your repository.  The end of the command is your repositories 
                        URL with <code>.Git</code> added onto the end.  So the Remote Origin we are adding is 
                        a destination URL where we push our code to add it to the Github repository.  But why 
                        is it called an origin instead of a destination?  Because often when people use Github 
                        they are working collabaratively and they are cloning (or copying) the code from the 
                        Github repository (the origin) to their local machine to work on it.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So that is how you specify the Remote Origin for a GIT repository.  Once you do this 
                        GIT will remember the Remote Origin for this repository.  You will only need to worry 
                        about the Remote Origin once per repository.  If you do something when you are setting 
                        up your Github repository and you don't have the little Cheat Page telling you these 
                        commands You can use the exact command above only with the URL for your new repository 
                        with <code>.Git</code> added onto the end.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now we want to push master branch.  <code>git push -u origin master</code> is the command 
                        to do this.  <code>git push</code> tells GIT you are pushing (or sending) something.  <code>-u
                        </code> tells GIT that the next thing is a URL.  Origin is the keyword that you use to
                        refer to the Remote Origin.  And lastly <code>master</code> is the code branch we are 
                        pushing.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Github will require you to login in to Github if this is your first time interacting 
                        with Github from the command line on this machine.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now, assuming everything went correctly, you will see a lot of things happening 
                        in the terminal.  When GIT finishes you will see <code>* [new branch] master --> master
                        </code> and <code>Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 
                        'origin'</code>.  This is basically saying that your original local 'master' branch 
                        is tracking the remote 'master' branch you just created.  Only one thing to do now,
                        go to your Github account and check out your no longer empty Github repository.

            <header><h4>Pushing your branch</h4></header>
            
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Since we just pushed the local master branch we are now ready to work with the local day3 branch.  
                        Right now we should have the index.html file available to see or change in the Github repository.
                        This was our master branch with the first title that we pushed to Github.  But we created the 
                        day3 branch and gave it a silly title.  So let us go back to the terminal.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You are now ready to push the commit with the day3 branch.  Because you created the commit in the
                        day3 branch you refer to the commit with the branch name.  The command is basically the
                        same as in the previous section.  The only differences is that you already added a remote and Github
                        authorized a personal access token for the computer you are on.  If you look in your email you will
                        probably see an automatically generated email from Github saying that a personal access token for 
                        your Github account was issued.  This is a security notice just like if you log into email on a 
                        different device and you get an email asking if that was you.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So now you can enter <code>git push -u origin day3</code>.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now just like when we pushed the 
                        master branch you will see a notice telling you that there is a new branch named day3 in the 
                        remote repository.  Lets go create a pull request!

            <header><h4>Pull Request</h4></header>

                <article>

                    <p>
                        Creating a pull request is a process with the main purpose of alerting the Repository
                        owner that you made changes or additions to their code and asking them to approve the
                        changes and merge them into their repository.  They can then approve and merge the 
                        pull request, suggest improvements to you should make, or reject the pull request.  
                        For us it is a little pointless since we are the repository owner and the ones making
                        the pull request to ourselves!  But it is good practice for collabarating with people.  
                        Also it creates documentation of your coding process.  This is very useful if you want
                        to work professionally as a developer.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>    
                        If you go to your Github repository you will see a tan notice telling you there is a 
                        new branch that you recently pushed.  There is a green Pull Request button.  Click it.
                    </p>

                        <img src="images/pull_request/pull_request_1.png" alt="open a pull request">

                    <p>
                        This will give you the option to add comments to attach to the pull request.  Above
                        the comment box Github tells you that you are comparing Master and Day3 branches.  
                        Next to this there is a green checkmark and 'Able To Merge.'  This is good.  It means
                        that there are no conflicts between to the 2 branches and GIT can merge them.  Go 
                        ahead and click 'Create Pull Request.'
                    </p>

                        <img src="images/pull_request/pull_request_2.png" alt="merge pull request">

                    <p>
                        Because you are the repository owner you will immediately see an option to merge
                        the pull request along with a notice that the branch can merge without conflict.  
                        If you want to see a side by side comparison of the Master branch and the day3 
                        branch there is a 'Files changed' tab you can click to compare them.  Go ahead 
                        and click 'Merge Pull Request.'
                    </p>

                        <img src="images/pull_request/pull-request-merged.png" alt="merged pull request">

                    <p>
                        Now you will see a purple Merged icon and Github will tell you the pull request 
                        was succesfully merged.  There is a 'Delete Branch' button.  We don't need the day3 
                        branch anymore so go ahead and delete it.  If you need it back there is an undo
                        button.  Now go ahead and click the blue link to the repository or find the 'Code' 
                        tab and click it.  Open the index.html file.  Find the now changed title 
                        and revel in your newfound ability to Git things done!
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Ok now we have succesfully created a pull request and merged it.  Our Github repository
                    now has the updated title.  But our local repository is not updated.  So go back to 
                    the terminal and switch back to the master branch.  Now enter <code>git pull origin
                        master</code>.           
                </p>

                    <img src="images/pulling_master/pull_origin_master.png" alt="pull origin master">
                
                <p>
                    This is like pushing the master or a branch to the origin (remote URL) except we are 
                    using the pull command.  The pull command gets the remote origin's master branch and 
                    merges it into our local code master branch.  This is very similar to the <code>git 
                    fetch</code> command except that <code>git pull</code> automatically merges the 
                    pulled code.  
                </p>

                    Now we just want to clean up our local GIT repository.  Since we updated or local master 
                    branch we don't need the day3 branch anymore.  Enter <code>git branch -d day3</code>.
