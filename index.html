            <p>Thanks for looking at my introductory Git Guide.  I recently went from zero
                to greater than zero with regards to my Git skills thanks to the guidance 
                of others and I want to help others do the same thing.  I hope you find this
                guide helpful.  
                <br/><br/>
                I am assumig the following things about you:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You have a computer</li>
                        <li>You have a code editor installed</li>
                        <li>If you don't have a code editor installed 
                            you will go download one and then return</li>
                        <li>I like Visual Studio Code.  
                            There are many good ones out there.  
                            Just pick one you have heard of and try it.  </li>
                        <li>You know how to write some code of some kind</li>
                        <li>You have a Github account</li>
                        <li>If you don't you might as well get one because it is free</li>
                        <li>This is optional.  
                            Only half of what we will be covering will be pointless 
                            if you don't.</li>
                    </ul>

                <article>
                    <p>All right lets get going!  What is GIT?  It is a free open source 
                        Version Control system.  What does that mean for you?  There are 
                        a lot of different really good reasons to use GIT.  The simplest 
                        answer in my opinion is that GIT allows you to fearlessly play, 
                        change, and experiment with your code without any fear of breaking
                        your code.  And it allows simple efficient social coding.  If you are 
                        going to work professionally with code you will probably need to learn 
                        it.   
                    <br/>
                        So, first thing is downloading GIT.  
                        <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">GIT for Windows</a>  Once 
                        the download finishes choose a folder to save it to.  When this is 
                        finished go to the file where you saved it to and click on the executable
                        file.  This will initiate the installation process.  Once you accept the 
                        terms it will create a GIT folder in your Programs folder.  You should 
                        accept the default settings.  Next it will give you some checkboxes for whether
                        you want the a desktop shortcut, a GIT GUI (or graphical user interface), 
                        and other options.  I recommend doing whatever you want but don't unselect 
                        the automatic options.  Next you can change the name of the folder.  You do you
                        boo.  
                    <br/>
                        Now we choose wether we want to use the GIT Bash (terminal) only or 
                        Windows Command Prompt (the windows terminal).  There is a third option that you 
                        will want to ignore becauseit is the most risky option.  The Git Bash is a GIT 
                        terminal that allows you 
                        to enter commands.  This option is the safest.  I would stick with the default 
                        Windows terminal because this lets you use either the GIT Bash or the Windows
                        Terminal and is nearly as safe.  Now just leave the rest of the options on the 
                        default settings and click next until it begins installation.  Once this installs
                        you can find and open the GIT Bash or the Command Prompt.  If you are using 
                        Visual Studio Code you can actually just open that and then hit Control - Plus - 
                        Backtick.  (The back-tick is the key to the loft of the 1 key.)  This opens the
                        integrated Visual Studio terminal.
